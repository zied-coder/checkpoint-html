      <h1>Anime:</h1>
      <p>
        Anime (Japanese: アニメ, IPA: [aɲime] (listen)) is hand-drawn and
        computer-generated animation originating from Japan. Outside of Japan
        and in English, anime refers to Japanese animation, and refers
        specifically to animation produced in Japan.[1] However, in Japan and in
        Japanese, anime (a term derived from a shortening of the English word
        animation) describes all animated works, regardless of style or origin.
        Animation produced outside of Japan with similar style to Japanese
        animation is commonly referred to as anime-influenced animation. The
        earliest commercial Japanese animations date to 1917. A characteristic
        art style emerged in the 1960s with the works of cartoonist Osamu Tezuka
        and spread in following decades, developing a large domestic audience.
        Anime is distributed theatrically, through television broadcasts,
        directly to home media, and over the Internet. In addition to original
        works, anime are often adaptations of Japanese comics (manga), light
        novels, or video games. It is classified into numerous genres targeting
        various broad and niche audiences. Anime is a diverse medium with
        distinctive production methods that have adapted in response to emergent
        technologies. It combines graphic art, characterization, cinematography,
        and other forms of imaginative and individualistic techniques.[2]
        Compared to Western animation, anime production generally focuses less
        on movement, and more on the detail of settings and use of "camera
        effects", such as panning, zooming, and angle shots.[2] Diverse art
        styles are used, and character proportions and features can be quite
        varied, with a common characteristic feature being large and emotive
        eyes.[3] The anime industry consists of over 430 production companies,
        including major studios such as Studio Ghibli, Sunrise, Bones, Ufotable,
        MAPPA, CoMix Wave Films and Toei Animation. Since the 1980s, the medium
        has also seen international success with the rise of foreign dubbed,
        subtitled programming and its increasing distribution through streaming
        services. As of 2016, Japanese animation accounted for 60% of the
        world's animated

      <h1>Attributes:</h1>
      <p>
        Anime differs from other forms of animation by its art styles, methods
        of animation, its production, and its process. Visually, anime works
        exhibit a wide variety of art styles, differing between creators,
        artists, and studios.[36] While no single art style predominates anime
        as a whole, they do share some similar attributes in terms of animation
        technique and character design. Anime is fundamentally characterized by
        the use of limited animation, flat expression, the suspension of time,
        its thematic range, the presence of historical figures, its complex
        narrative line and, above all, a peculiar drawing style, with characters
        characterized by large and oval eyes, with very defined lines, bright
        colors and reduced movement of the lips.

      <h1>Music:</h1>
      <p>
        The opening and credits sequences of most anime television series are
        accompanied by J-pop or J-rock songs, often by reputed bands—as written
        with the series in mind—but are also aimed at the general music market,
        therefore they often allude only vaguely or not at all, to the thematic
        settings or plot of the series. Also, they are often used as incidental
        music ("insert songs") in an episode, in order to highlight particularly
        important scenes.
      </p>
      <h1>Genres</h1>
      <p>
        Anime are often classified by target demographic, including children's
        (子供, kodomo), girls' (少女, shōjo), boys' (少年, shōnen) and a diverse
        range of genres targeting an adult audience. Shoujo and shounen anime
        sometimes contain elements popular with children of both sexes in an
        attempt to gain crossover appeal. Adult anime may feature a slower pace
        or greater plot complexity that younger audiences may typically find
        unappealing, as well as adult themes and situations.[67] A subset of
        adult anime works featuring pornographic elements are labeled "R18" in
        Japan, and are internationally known as hentai (originating from pervert
        (変態, hentai)). By contrast, some anime subgenres incorporate ecchi,
        sexual themes or undertones without depictions of sexual intercourse, as
        typified in the comedic or harem genres; due to its popularity among
        adolescent and adult anime enthusiasts, the inclusion of such elements
        is considered a form of fan service.[68][69] Some genres explore
        homosexual romances, such as yaoi (male homosexuality) and yuri (female
        homosexuality). While often used in a pornographic context, the terms
        yaoi and yuri can also be used broadly in a wider context to describe or
        focus on the themes or the development of the relationships
        themselves.[70] Anime's genre classification differs from other types of
        animation and does not lend itself to simple classification.[71] Gilles
        Poitras compared the labeling Gundam 0080 and its complex depiction of
        war as a "giant robot" anime akin to simply labeling War and Peace a
        "war novel".[71] Science fiction is a major anime genre and includes
        important historical works like Tezuka's Astro Boy and Yokoyama's
        Tetsujin 28-go. A major subgenre of science fiction is mecha, with the
        Gundam metaseries being iconic.[72] The diverse fantasy genre includes
        works based on Asian and Western traditions and folklore; examples
        include the Japanese feudal fairytale InuYasha, and the depiction of
        Scandinavian goddesses who move to Japan to maintain a computer called
        Yggdrasil in Ah! My Goddess.[73] Genre crossing in anime is also
        prevalent, such as the blend of fantasy and comedy in Dragon Half, and
        the incorporation of slapstick humor in the crime anime film Castle of
        Cagliostro.[74] Other subgenres found in anime include magical girl,
        harem, sports, martial arts, literary adaptations, medievalism,[75] and
        war.
